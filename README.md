# KeyboardSoundPlayer

KeyboardSoundPlayer is a program written in python that allows you to play a certain mp3 file when a certain key is pressed.
You can use you own mp3 file. You have to name it the name of the key. E.g. left.mp3 is played when the left arrow is pressed.
You can also create a keys.json file to have KeyboardSoundPlayer auto generate mp3 files. See <a href="https://github.com/Nebulizer1213/KeyboardSoundPlayer/blob/master/keys.json">keys.json</a> for an example.
To change the gender or rate of the voice that is used for the autogenerated mp3 files you need to make a config.json file. See <a href="https://github.com/Nebulizer1213/KeyboardSoundPlayer/blob/master/config.json">config.json</a> for an example.
To close the program press the escape key 5 time in the span of 2 seconds.
